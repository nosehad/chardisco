<p>This is a very small app I wrote to improve my writing skills. Just <strong>select a font you like</strong> and start adapting your dream-handwriting  today. Btw; this site is still work-in-progress and was created for personal use. Please submit any bugs <a href="https://github.com/nosehad/chardisco">here</a>.</p>
